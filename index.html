                    <p class="article-paragraphs">
                        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and
                        is intended to quantify tissue mass.
                        It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their
                        height.
                        Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a
                        person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value
                        falls between.
                        These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further
                        divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese.
                        Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an
                        imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional
                        testing or action is required.
                        Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the
                        calculator.</p>

                        (CDC):</p>

                        Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25 kg/m2,
                        but ideally should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any

                            <li>Possible reproductive issues for women due to hormonal imbalances that can disrupt the

                        anorexia nervosa,
                        which has its own risks.
                        Consult your doctor if you think you or someone you know is underweight,

                    <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
                    <p class="article-paragraphs">
                        Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight,
                        it does have its limitations.
                        BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account.
                        Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat,
                        BMI should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method
                        for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-paragraphs">In Adults</h3>
                    <p class="article-paragraphs">
                        BMI cannot be fully accurate because it is a measure of excess body weight,
                        rather than excess body fat.
                        BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass,
                        body fat, and activity level, among others. For example,
                        an older person who is considered a healthy weight, but is completely
                        inactive in their daily life may have significant amounts of excess body fat even though they
                        are not heavy.
                        This would be considered unhealthy, while a younger person with higher muscle composition of the
                        same BMI would be considered healthy.
                        In athletes, particularly bodybuilders who would be considered overweight due to muscle being
                        heavier than fat,
                        it is entirely possible that they are actually at a healthy weight for their body composition.
                        Generally, according to the CDC:</p>

                    <div class="lists">

                            <li>Older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults with the same BMI.</li>
                            <li>Women tend to have more body fat than men for an equivalent BMI.</li>
                            <li>Muscular individuals and highly trained athletes may have higher BMIs due to large
                                muscle mass.</li>

                    <p class="article-paragraphs">
                        The same factors that limit the efficacy of BMI for adults can also apply to children and
                        adolescents.
                        Additionally, height and level of sexual maturation can influence BMI and body fat among
                        children.
                        BMI is a better indicator of excess body fat for obese children than it is for overweight
                        children,
                        whose BMI could be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass (all body
                        components except for fat,
                        which includes water, organs, muscle, etc.). In thin children, the difference in BMI can also be
